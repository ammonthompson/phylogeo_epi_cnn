Basic setup:

beast 2 with the package MASTER installed for simulation. 
Assumes the executable is called "beast2" is in a directory in 
your $PATH. In a directory in your path make the following soft link: 
ln -s /path/to/bin/beast beast2

R,Rscript with the following libraries for simulation and analysis:
vioplot, expm, BEST, phytools, rjson

pyhon3 with the following packages for machine learning:
numpy, scipy, pandas, ete3, matplotlib, keras, sklearn

If simulating genome sequence evolution:
Assumes seq-gen is in your $PATH

# Basic command to simulate training and test trees:
randomParams_Simulation.sh control_file.txt num_locations sim_num_from,sim_num_to output/file_prefix
for example
./randomParams_Simulation.sh control_files/testing_controlfile.txt 5 1,10 sim_output/mytest
